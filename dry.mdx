## DRY
The idea that each piece of logic should exist in one and only one place in a system. Adhering to the DRY principle, we can ensure maintainability and scalability.

## Advantages
- **Readability:** When each piece of logic exists in one place, it’s easier for other developers (and yourself) to understand the flow. 
- **Easier Maintenance:** Any necessary changes or fixes need to be applied to the single location rather than multiple which in-turn reduces the chances of creating bugs or missing another part of the code to be fixed
- **Easier Testing:** When code isn’t duplicated, testing is straightforward since you only have to test one module or piece of code 
- **Development Efficiency**
- **Optimized Resource Usage:** Less repeated code will most likely lead to faster execution and can have less memory consumption
- **Less Error-Prone:** Centralizing code has the benefit of less area for bugs. Repeating logic multiple places, changes to one might not be replicated in others, producing inconsistencies and likely errors


## Some Simple Examples to get the Idea Across
#### UI Components:
***Non-DRY:*** For every page in a website where you need a specific button style, you write the CSS for that button.
```ts
const Button1 = styled.button`
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
  // ... other styles
`;

const Button2 = styled.button`
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
  // ... other styles
`;
```
***DRY:*** You define the button style once in a central CSS file and reuse that class on every page where the button appears.
```ts
const BaseButton = styled.button`
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
  // ... other styles
`;

const Button1 = styled(BaseButton)``;
const Button2 = styled(BaseButton)``;
```

#### Database Connection:
***Non-DRY:*** Every time you need to connect to a database, you write the connection logic.
```ts
function addUser() {
  const connection = /* database connection logic */;
  // logic to add user
}

function deleteUser() {
  const connection = /* database connection logic */;
  // logic to delete user
}
```
***DRY:*** You create a single function or class that handles database connections. Whenever you need to connect, you call this function or instantiate this class.
```ts
function getDBConnection() {
  return /* database connection logic */;
}

function addUser() {
  const connection = getDBConnection();
  // logic to add user
}

function deleteUser() {
  const connection = getDBConnection();
  // logic to delete user
}
```

#### Data Validation:
***Non-DRY:*** Before inserting or updating data in various parts of an application, you write validation logic for that data each time.
```ts
function saveUserData(user: any) {
  if (!user.name || !user.email) {
    throw new Error('Invalid user data');
  }
  // save user logic
}

function updateUserDetails(details: any) {
  if (!details.name || !details.email) {
    throw new Error('Invalid user data');
  }
  // update user logic
}
```
***DRY:*** You create a single validation module or function for that data type and call it whenever validation is needed.
```ts
function validateUserData(data: any) {
  if (!data.name || !data.email) {
    throw new Error('Invalid user data');
  }
}

function saveUserData(user: any) {
  validateUserData(user);
  // save user logic
}

function updateUserDetails(details: any) {
  validateUserData(details);
  // update user logic
}
```

Adhering to DRY I believe is essential for all developers. Looking back on the first code I ever wrote, I struggled with this at times. I also recall getting stuck on bugs and would always lose track of what things did and why they did it. By repeating certain parts of code I would easily get overwhelmed and frustrated. After learning about DRY and putting it into practice, I have felt more confident in the code because it is easier to read, test, and understand the system as a whole. I hope you find this information useful! Thanks for reading and always strive for the best!
