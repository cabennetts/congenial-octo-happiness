### In this blog post I wanted to take it back a few years and showcase how I modeled my relational database for my Databases Course project

When tasked with designing an application, we had a few requirements
<ul> 
    <li>it has to obviously be connected to a database</li>
    <li>must have at least 4 tables</li>
    <li>minimum of 5 SQL queries</li>
</ul>

I had the idea to make a social media application. Some features I wanted are:
- create an account
- make a post
- follow users
- make a comment
- like posts
